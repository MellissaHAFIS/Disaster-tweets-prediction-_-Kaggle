In this project, we aim to predict whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not by leveraging natural language processing techniques.
We apply multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, RidgeClassifier, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classifier, to analyze and classify the tweets.

Note: all the details are in the notebook. Ckeck it out :)
